# steam-collector-backend
This is the NodeJS backend for the SteamCollector webpage. It primarily serves two functions:

1.) It exposes a typical CRUD rest API that can be used to access information about users (and their linked steam accounts), apps on steam, collections made by users, and relations between those. 

2.) It uses the Mongoose Javascript library to interact with a MongoDB database. Associated schemas and models are included, as is some example data.
